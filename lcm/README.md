There are many different ways to find the least common multiple of two integers, m and n. The worst way uses two loops with O(N^2) complexity to compare all multiples of m and n leading up to the comparison of product of (m)(n) and (n)(m) which of course will be the same. It's worth noting that the product (m)(n) is the worst case least common multiple of two integers m and n, which occurs when they are relatively prime or have no factors greater than 1 in common. The algorithm implemented here is calculating the greatest common divisor using euclid's algorithm, and then dividing the product of the two numbers by the gcd. This quotient is the least common multiple of our two integers m and n.
