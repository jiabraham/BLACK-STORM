This program written in python takes two integers greater than 1 as arguments. Then, using Euclid's Algorithm, is able to
find the greatest common divisor between the integers. This is a classical recursion problem that requires taking the mod
of the arguments, taking the mod of smaller argument and the result of the previous mod. This continues until one of the 
calculations results in 1 or 0, meaning the numbers are relatively prime or a gcd greater than 1 does in fact exist.
